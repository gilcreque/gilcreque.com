    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of people I know I rarely listen to the radio anymore. I listen to quite a few podcasts throughout the week and my list is ever changing depending on my mood. I have come across quite a few podcasts that are about software and web development and I thought I would share them here in case others are interested. There are plenty more podcasts where these came from but here are just a few to get you started.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://hanselminutes.com/"><strong>The Hanselminutes Podcast</strong></a> Described as the &ldquo;Fresh Air for Developers&rdquo;, Scott Hanselman interviews a variety of technical people.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast"><strong>CodeNewbie</strong></a> This is somewhat focused on people who are just starting out in their developer career. This show also has a great community that allows new developers to help each other out.</li>
<li><a href="https://developertea.com/"><strong>Developer Tea</strong></a> I found this podcast recently via someone&rsquo;s tweet asking for podcasts like CodeNewbie. It was a great find. I have already listened to quite few episodes in the week since I&rsquo;ve discovered it. This focuses on web development and the show&rsquo;s premise is it can be listened to while you have a cup of tea.</li>
</ul>
