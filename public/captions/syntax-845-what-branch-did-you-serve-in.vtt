I'm curious how you make yourself appear that way to people because like often I

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.200
find myself going to like like a Starbucks or something like that and the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.200
person working behind the counter is just so personable so dialed like and I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.080
just I think I often tell my wife like man if I had a job for that person I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
would snipe them you know they seem great they seem awesome and I bet that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.160
they would do a really good job working somewhere not that Starbucks is not a

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.740
good job but I feel like they could have a really good career doing that type of thing.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.720
Yeah like but what is that that you just notice it? You know it's funny I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.560
listened to a comedian a while back and he said so we don't have any world wars

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.360
in our generation right I mean I don't I mean I'm sure we have conversations

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.280
about that but regardless we have we have not gone through World War one

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.360
World War two right Cold War and that stuff so the comedian was like our World

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.920
War one or World War two is working in the restaurant industry the retail

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.560
industry gosh or the or the hotel industry there's basically like where we

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320
served or like our branches of military essentially and so my branches of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.040
military quote-unquote was the restaurant industry and in the in the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.480
retail because I worked at Banana Republic for a bit. You are taught

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.000
something different that you are not taught in a desk job and like I look for

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.040
like when I hire people I look for people who like did like when I was

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.440
hiring my recruiting teams I wouldn't hire anybody who actually had a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.360
recruiting experience. You can teach recruiting experience.
