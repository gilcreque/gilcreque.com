I ran across this Tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Typescript is silly because it just gets turned back into typeless code when you hit compile” oh man do I have some upsetting news about C++ for you</p>&mdash; Jules Glegg 🏳️‍⚧️ (@heyjulesfern) <a href="https://twitter.com/heyjulesfern/status/1504132661920497666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and started reading the comments and ran across the idea of branding in Typescript. I did a quick search to learn more and found [this interesting write up on branding and type tagging](https://medium.com/@KevinBGreene/surviving-the-typescript-ecosystem-branding-and-type-tagging-6cf6e516523d).
