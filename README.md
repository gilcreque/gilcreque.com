## About Me

I&#8217;m a Senior Software Engineer and full-stack web developer at Codecraft Works, where I lead software development working on an NSF backed education technology platform.

I am graduate of UCF (Go Knights!) but I consider myself a life-long learner, technologist, and tech early-adopter. I currently do work in Angular, Firebase, Google Cloud, ASP.NET, AWS, and STEM Education. I dabble in PHP (I used to primarily work in Wordpress and then Drupal), Python, and Java. I am also an organizer for Google Developer Group Space Coast
